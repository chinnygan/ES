Embeddded Systems Coursework 2
Scott Postlethwaite & Paulius Gedminas

The code is running through the main file. The additional files required are button.c, uart.c, 
filter0.c, filter1.c, filter2.c & filter3.c with their corresponding header files. The data is piped
into main which will choose a filter based on the current selected state (chosen by push buttons on
the board) and run the input through this before sending the filtered raw data back. The current state
will be shown on the board by a corresponding LED light.

There are 4 filters on the board.
0(BLUE)		:  500-1000Hz Single Order Band Pass
0(GREEN)	: 1500-1750Hz Single Order Band Pass
0(YELLOW)	: 2000-2500Hz Single Order Band Pass
0(RED)		: 3000-3750Hz Single Order Band Pass

The main file is compiled by the makefile and flashed to the board (usually due to scripts on ACM0). 

There is a simple (on dice) test for the filter in filtertest folder, main code for the board can be
found in the "Template" folder.

Test runs with all 4 filters on the board can be found in "AudioFiles/TestFiles"
